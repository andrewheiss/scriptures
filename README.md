# The Standard Works #

Forked from Ben Crowder's project at http://github.com/bencrowder/scriptures/

## To do ##

* `g` key only works when site is placed in server root
* `g` menu fails with 1 Nephi, 2 Kings, etc.
* Make it work both as a subfolder (http://example/scriptures) and as root (http://scriptures/) (for local use)
* Next/previous links at beginning and end of books
* Set a cookie or something to remember pilcrow display preference?
